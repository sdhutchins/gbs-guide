# GBS Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the Graduate Biomedical Sciences (GBS) doctoral program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). This guide is designed to assist you in navigating the program effectively and making the most of your academic journey.

## Getting Started

### Incoming Student Checklist

- [ ] Complete the [GBS Incoming Student Checklist](https://www.uab.edu/gbs/home/student-resources/incoming-student-checklist)
- [ ] Connect with your assigned GBS peer mentor.
- [ ] Decide on (at least) your first lab rotation.

## Lab Rotations

### Exploring Research Opportunities

### Selecting Rotation Mentors

During your initial lab rotations, you'll have the chance to collaborate with esteemed faculty members across diverse research domains. This experience will help you identify potential research mentors for your doctoral studies.

A few tips on how to find a good rotation mentor:

- Select a PI to rotate with who can either help you gain skills that will help you in another lab or a PI who has explicitly stated they are taking on more students and have the funding to do so.
- Always ask students in later years (2nd years and upwards) about the reputation of the PI.
- If there are more negative than positive reviews of the PI, it is likely best to AVOID.
    - Labs that have toxic cultures very rarely suddenly change or change because of a new student.

### Engaging in Rotations

Lab rotations provide a hands-on experience in different research labs. This exposure allows you to learn various research methodologies, understand lab dynamics, and explore potential research projects.

A few tips on how to make the most of your rotation:

- Take notes about your rotation and note how you feel each day
- Try to get to know the people in the lab so you can learn as much about what it's like to be in the lab and whether you would want to be around those people for the next 4-5 years
- Ask as many questions as you can about the lab and mentor
    - Do you come to the lab on weekends?
    - Do you feel pressure to work a lot of hours?
    - How many hours do you work per week?
    - When you feel overwhelmed, do you feel comfortable enough to ask for breaks?
    - Are you able to take vacations/time off when you want or need to?
