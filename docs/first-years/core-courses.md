## Academic Readiness

To make sure you're prepared for the coursework:

- Review course syllabi carefully to understand expectations and grading criteria.
- Reach out to second-year or senior GBS students for study tips.
- Seek out study resources like the course textbooks or online materials/tutorials.
- Be prepared to utilize tutoring services (contact the GBS office) if you find yourself struggling.
- If you suspect you may need accommodations, contact the UAB Disability Support Services.

## Study Tips

Here are some strategies to help you succeed in your coursework:

- **Form Study Groups**: Collaborating with classmates can provide diverse perspectives and help clarify difficult concepts. It will also help you build relationships.
- **Utilize GBS Tutors**: Don’t hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance from GBS tutors.
- **Review Lecture Notes Daily**: Regularly go over your notes to reinforce what you've learned. Small, consistent reviews are more effective than last-minute cramming.
- **Take Breaks**: Include short breaks in your study sessions to avoid burnout and keep your focus sharp.

## Academic Integrity

Maintaining academic integrity is crucial for your success and reputation as a graduate student. 

Here are a few examples of what constitutes cheating and how to avoid it:

1. **Unauthorized Collaboration**: Working with other students on individual assignments when not permitted. Always follow guidelines on whether collaboration is allowed, and if in doubt, ask your instructor.

2. **Using Unapproved Resources**: Referencing notes, books, or online resources during a closed-book exam or on homework where outside help is prohibited. Stick to the allowed materials and tools for any given assignment.

3. **Sharing Test Information**: Discussing or sharing test content with classmates who haven't taken the exam yet, or obtaining information from someone who already has. This includes both direct conversations and online platforms.

4. **Submitting Someone Else's Work**: Turning in assignments, homework, or lab reports that you did not personally complete, or copying answers from another student. Ensure all work you submit is your own effort, even when working in study groups.

5. **Taking Photos of Tests**: Capturing screenshots or taking photos of exams, test questions, or answer sheets to share with others or use later is strictly prohibited. Respect exam integrity by avoiding any unauthorized recordings.

These examples clarify what constitutes academic dishonesty in the context of coursework and exams, ensuring a fair and respectful academic environment for everyone.

## More Resources for Success

Make the most of the resources available to you:

- **Library Access**: Use [Lister Hill Library](https://library.uab.edu/locations/lister-hill) (open to 11 PM Mon-Thurs) or [Mervyn H. Sterne Library](https://library.uab.edu/locations/sterne) (24 hours Mon-Thurs) for access to study spaces.
- **Study Apps**: Consider apps like Anki or Quizlet for effective flashcard-based learning.
- **Mental Health Support**: Remember that academic pressure can be intense; reach out to counseling services if needed.

## Building Good Habits

Developing effective study habits early on can make a significant difference:

- **Set a Routine**: Consistency is key. Create a study schedule and stick to it. Study a little bit every day.
- **Stay Organized**: Keep track of assignments, deadlines, and important dates with a planner or digital calendar.

## Conclusion

Remember that the first semester is a time of adjustment. Give yourself the grace to make mistakes and learn from them. You’re not alone in this process—lean on your peers, faculty, and the resources provided to help you succeed.
