{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Incoming Student Checklist

- [ ] Complete the [GBS Incoming Student Checklist](https://www.uab.edu/gbs/home/student-resources/incoming-student-checklist)
- [ ] Decide on (at least) your first (by mid-July) and second (by early September) lab rotations.



## Preparing for Your First Semester

### 1st Semester Courses

### Academic Readiness

- Familiarize yourself with the course syllabi and required readings.
- Reach out to current students for insights and advice on courses.
- Seek a GBS tutor if you are struggling in courses - everyone does at some point.

## Active Engagement on Campus

### Involvement Benefits

Participating in campus activities enhances your graduate experience, fosters networking, and facilitates personal and professional growth.

It's a good idea to **reserve your 1st year for adjusting to the program and coursework**. However, you can still engage in various activities to build connections and explore opportunities.
