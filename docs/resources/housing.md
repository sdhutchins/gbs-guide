## Off-Campus Student and Family Engagement

Visit [UAB's Off-Campus Housing Website](https://offcampushousing.uab.edu/) to find apartments, search for roommates,
post a roommate profile, and more.

Also, [contact them](https://www.uab.edu/studentaffairs/off-campus-and-family/off-campus-students) to learn more.

## On-Campus Housing

In the past this has not been an option for graduate students, but it is worth checking with [UAB Housing](https://www.uab.edu/students/housing/about/contact) to see if this has changed.

## RentMonster

All UAB students can utilize [RentMonster](https://rentmonster.net/how-it-works/) for FREE for help finding an apartment. This is a really helpful resource.

## Should I sublease from someone?

Please be careful when subletting. There are many scams out there, and many students have been taken advantage of in the past.

If you are unsure about a listing, contact senior student (or staff person) who has been in Birmingham for a few years to help you evaluate the listing and ensure it is legitimate.
